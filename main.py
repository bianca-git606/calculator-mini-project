# Hello guys !! welcome to our first mini project,, <333 -bianca

# you can choose any function you'd like to code
# refer to the divide function for a sample code
# dont worry we will add more code later on when we start with unit tests
# (e.g. if statements in case the inputs are not a number etc.)

# after this, we will write unit tests for each function that we coded
# in order to do that, please run this command on the terminal:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# then run this:
# nosetests
# if it said OK then u're good to go ! :))


def add (a, b): 
    pass # replace this code 

def subtract (a, b): 
    pass # replace this code

def multiply (a, b): 
    pass # replace this code

def divide (a, b): 
    # a sample code
    if b == 0:
        raise ZeroDivisionError("0 is not a valid denominator.")
    return a / b

def modulo (a, b): 
    pass # replace this code
